    <h2 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">What is Zero hunger?</h2>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2 or Global Goal 2) aims to achieve "zero hunger". 
    <br>It is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording is: 
    <br>"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture".
    <br>SDG 2 highlights the complex inter-linkages between food security, nutrition, rural transformation and sustainable agriculture. 
    <br>According to the United Nations, there are around 690 million people who are hungry, which accounts for slightly less 
    <br>than 10 percent of the world population. One in every nine people goes to bed hungry each night, 
    <br>including 20 million people currently at risk of famine in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Nigeria.
    <br>SDG 2 has eight targets and 14 indicators to measure progress. The five "outcome targets" are:
    <br>ending hunger and improving access to food; ending all forms of malnutrition; agricultural productivity; 
    <br>sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices; and genetic diversity of seeds, 
    <br>cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals; investments, research and technology. The three 
    <br>"means of achieving" targets include: addressing trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural 
    <br>markets and food commodity markets and their derivatives.
    <br>Under-nutrition has been on the rise since 2015, after falling for decades. This majorly results 
    <br>from the various stresses in food systems that include; climate shocks, the locust crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
    <br>Those threats indirectly reduce the purchasing power and the capacity to produce and distribute food, which affects the 
    <br>most vulnerable populations and furthermore has reduced their accessibility to food. Up to 142 million people in 2020, 
    <br>have suffered from undernourishment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stunting and wasting children statistics are 
    <br>likely to worsen with the pandemic. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic "may add between 83 and 132 million people to the
    <br>total number of undernourished in the world by the end of 2020 depending on the economic growth scenario"

    <h3 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">What is the backgorund of zero hunger</h3>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 
    <br>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that included 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
    <br>Building on the principle of "leaving no one behind", the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic 
    <br>approach to achieving sustainable development for all. In September 2019, Heads of State 
    <br>and Government came together during the SDG Summit to renew their commitment to implement 
    <br>the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. During this event, they acknowledged that the 
    <br>first four years of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda included major progress, but that
    <br>overall, the world is not on track to deliver the SDGs. This is when "the decade of action" 
    <br>and "delivery for sustainable development" was launched, demanding stakeholders to speed up 
    <br>the process and efforts of implementation.
    <br>SDG 2 aims to end all forms of malnutrition and hunger by 2030 and ensure that everyone has 
    <br>sufficient food throughout the year, especially children. Chronic malnutrition, which affects
    <br>an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical 
    <br>development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults.
    <br>As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries were on track to meet the SDG target to 
    <br>eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress 
    <br>at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. 
    <br>"There is less than enough food produced today to feed every last one of us." According 
    <br>to FAO, there are almost 690 million people who remain chronically undernourished. 
    <br>This number has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because of rapid economic 
    <br>growth and increased agricultural productivity.
    <br>Malnutrition and extreme hunger constitute a crucial barrier to sustainable development. 
    <br>Both create a trap from which people cannot escape. Hungry people are less productive 
    <br>and easily prone to diseases. As such, they will be unable to improve their livelihood

    <h4 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Development of the concept</h4>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">The UN has defined 8 targets and 
    <br>13 indicators for SDG 2. Four of them are to be achieved by the year 2030,
    <br>one by the year 2020 and three have no target years. Each of the targets 
    <br>also has one or more indicators to measure progress. In total there are
    <br>fourteen indicators for SDG 2. The six targets include ending hunger and
    <br>increasing access to food (2.1), ending all forms of malnutrition (2.2),
    <br>agricultural productivity (2.3), sustainable food production systems 
    <br>and resilient agricultural practices (2.4), genetic diversity of seeds, 
    <br>cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals (2.5), investments, 
    <br>research and technology (2.a), trade restrictions and distortions in world 
    <br>agricultural markets (2.b) and food commodity markets and their derivatives (2.c).

    <h5 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Tools</h5>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">The Global Hunger Index (GHI)
    <br>
    <br>The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool designed to measure and 
    <br>track hunger at global, regional, and national levels.
    <br>Each year, GHI scores are calculated to track progress and setbacks 
    <br>in fighting hunger. The GHI is designed to raise awareness and 
    <br>understanding of the struggle against hunger. It provides a way to 
    <br>compare levels of hunger between countries and regions. It calls 
    <br>attention to areas of the world where hunger levels are highest and 
    <br>where additional efforts are needed to eliminate hunger.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <br>The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI)
    <br>
    <br>The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) is a measure of the monthly 
    <br>change in international prices of a basket of food commodities.
    <br>Monitoring of food prices is provided by publicly available 
    <br>sources including food price index (FAO-FPI): 
    <br>monitoring prices monthly, with trends analysed 
    <br>biannually by the Food Outlook publication; reporting 
    <br>on food import bills is provided quarterly by the Crop 
    <br>Prospects and Food Situation publication, and quarterly 
    <br>WFP Global Market Monitor: reporting on price trends of 
    <br>staple commodities in approximately 70 countries and 
    <br>monthly country-specific market bulletins.
    <br>The GIEWS Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA)
    <br>provides an analysis of domestic price trends of basic 
    <br>foods at global level and latest food market policy developments 
    <br>as well as early warnings on exceptionally high food prices at the 
    <br>country level that may negatively affect food security.

    <h6 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Overall progress and challenges</h6>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">Despite the progress, research 
    <br>shows that more than 790 million people worldwide still suffer from hunger. 
    <br>There has been major progress in the fight against hunger over the last 15 years. 
    <br>In 2017, during a side event at the High-Level Political Forum under the theme 
    <br>of "Accelerating progress towards achieving SDG 2: Lessons from national implementation", 
    <br>a series of recommendations and actions were discussed. Stakeholders like the French UN 
    <br>mission, Action Against Hunger, Save The Children and Global Citizen were steering 
    <br>the conversation. It is unlikely there will be an end to malnutrition on the African continent by 2030.
    <br>To achieve progress towards SDG 2 the world needs to build political will and country ownership. 
    <br>It also needs to improve the narrative around nutrition to make sure that 
    <br>it is well understood by political leaders and address gender inequality, 
    <br>geographic inequality and absolute poverty. It also calls for concrete 
    <br>actions including working at sub-national levels, increasing nutrition 
    <br>funding and ensuring they target the first 1000 days of life and going 
    <br>beyond actions that address only the immediate causes of malnutrition 
    <br>and look at the drivers of under-nutrition, as well as at the food 
    <br>system as a whole.

    <h7 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Links with other SDGs</h7>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">The SDGs are deeply interconnected. 
    <br>All goals could be affected if progress on one specific goal is not achieved.
    <br>Climate change and natural disasters are affecting food security. 
    <br>Disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and mitigation 
    <br>are essential to increase harvests quality and quantity. 
    <br>Targets 2.4 and 2.5 are directly linked to the environment.
    <br>Reducing hunger can directly help in advancing Goals SDG 1, 
    <br>SDG 3 and SDG 8 by increasing rural and developing country 
    <br>incomes and access to nutrition. Since a significant number 
    <br>of farmers, especially in Africa and Asia, are women, advancing 
    <br>SDG 2 can also impact SDG 5, gender equality. Hunger and 
    <br>Agriculture are also linked to SDG 6 (when dealing with water 
    <br>scarcity and pollution), SDG 13 (when discussing greenhouse gas emissions) 
    <br>and SDG 15 (since it is linked to soil degradation).
